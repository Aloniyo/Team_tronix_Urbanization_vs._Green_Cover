# Team_tronix_Urbanization_vs._Green_Cover


Urban Growth and Its Impact on Green Cover in Major Cities
This project investigates how urban growth metrics (such as population density and built-up area) affect green cover in major cities. The analysis includes preprocessing data, building predictive models, and visualizing trends over time. Below is a comprehensive guide to understand and use the provided codebase.

Project Overview
Objective
To analyze the relationship between urban growth and green cover percentage in major cities using a dataset containing various metrics such as population density, built-up area, green cover percentage, and time-series data.

Key Questions Addressed
What is the correlation between urban growth indicators and green cover percentage?
How well can urban growth metrics predict changes in green cover?
What are the temporal trends in urban growth and green cover over time?
Prerequisites
Libraries Used
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:

Core Libraries: pandas, numpy
Data Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
Machine Learning: scikit-learn
Install these packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Dataset
The project uses a dataset data.csv containing:

Features: population_density, built_up_area, green_cover_percentage, etc.
Time Series Columns: Year, Urban Population, Urban Area (sq km), Green Cover Area (sq km)
Ensure that data.csv is placed in the same directory as the script.

How to Run the Code
Load the Dataset

The script automatically reads the dataset using:
python
Copy code
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
Preprocessing

Handles missing values in numeric columns by filling them with column means.
Ensures the dataset is clean before modeling.
Model Building

Splits the data into training and testing sets.
Trains a Random Forest Regressor to predict green_cover_percentage based on urban growth metrics.
Evaluation

Evaluates the model using metrics such as MSE, R-squared, and MAE.
Cross-validates the model using 5-fold cross-validation.
Visualizations

Scatter plots, heatmaps, and feature importance charts.
Temporal trend plots for urban growth and green cover.
Output

Displays model evaluation metrics.
Generates several plots to visualize relationships and trends.
Key Sections of the Code
Data Preprocessing

Missing values are filled with the mean of their respective columns.
Non-numeric columns are excluded.
Modeling

Uses RandomForestRegressor for predictions.
Evaluates the model using test data and cross-validation.
Visualizations

Scatter Plots: Explore relationships between features and the target variable.
Heatmaps: Examine correlations between variables.
Trend Analysis: Time-series plots for population, urban area, and green cover.
How to Customize
Feature Selection: Modify X to include other features.
Model Tuning: Adjust RandomForestRegressor hyperparameters (e.g., n_estimators).
Dataset Updates: Replace data.csv with a different dataset (ensure similar structure).
Sample Output
Model Evaluation Metrics:
